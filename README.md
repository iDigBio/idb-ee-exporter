# Code for exporting data sets for parties interested in maintaining copies of iDigBio

EE, and other mirroring parties, want differences/incremental data. Use CSV as an interchance format, limit fields to what's in the index, use a flat representation of the data akin to our existing download system however, pack everything in to one file. Diffs/patches of CSVs are probably not useful since that helps construct a whole snapshot in CSV form when what people want is to know what operations they need to do on thier data system to update their data. (I suppose people could write a diff/patch text format to database operation converter but we could be more helpful to them by providing better info.) What they likely want is records flagged as new/change/del so they can read them and apply their data update process to each. Would be cool for our own explorations too since the only change over time metric we currently have is total number of records.

## File naming

* idigbio-datetime1-ee.csv.bz2 as the base full dump at a specific time
* idigbio-datetime1-datetime2-ee-diff.csv.bz2 as the first diff between T1 full and T2 full
* idigbio-datetime2-ee.csv.bz2 as the base full dump at second time

Each diff can be applied in order to move the data version up to the next one. Any full copy can be used as a starting point. The datemodified field is discontinious enough that it should be easy to tell what full snapshot you're currently on by looking at the max, that is unless two full snapshots are identical, the max datetime will be different.


## Code outline

### Differ

Given two full exports in parquet form generated by [GUODA](https://github.com/bio-guoda/guoda-datasets/tree/master/iDigBio), generate a list of records that are different and add a column that is new/change/del to indicate the operation needed. Write out a .parquet with the differences back to the HDFS store in /guoda/outputs. Differences are determined by the presence or absence of record identifiers (iDigBio uuids) and by the last mode date of records. This means that the individual field changes are not tracked and whole rows need to be replaced when updating a record.

1. Exporter - Given a full dump parquet, format the data for EE and write out a slimmed .parquet

1. Checker - Given a starting full export, sequence of diffs, and a final export, verify the diffs yeild the final
1. Publisher - Move a .parquet into a csv on Ceph


## Attribution

How do people using EE know who is responsible for providing the data they're looking at?
